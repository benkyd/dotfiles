## Ben's Amazing Dotfile Installer

NOTE THIS ONLY WORKS IF THE USERNAME IS benk

ALSO BEN NEEDS TO GET HIS NEOVIM CONFIG TO BOOTSTRAP ON A NEW MACHINE! 

It appears Ben doesn't want to do this, so this message should remain until he does. 

The only prerequisite for Ben's Amazing Dotfile Installer is to install nodejs

`node bootstrap.js [--os[-o] ubuntu/arch] [--host[-h] host/laptop]`

NOTE: This will install and set up everything but it will not source tmux for example, you must `<C-b>I` in order to do that
