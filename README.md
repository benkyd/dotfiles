## Ben's Amazing Dotfile Installer
The only prerequisite for Ben's Amazing Dotfile Installer is to install nodejs

`node bootstrap.js [--os[-o] ubuntu/arch] [--host[-h] host/laptop]`

NOTE: This will install and set up everything but it will not source tmux for example, you must `<C-b>I` in order to do that
